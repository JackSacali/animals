    The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.<br>
    It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. <br>
    The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.<br>
    It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.<br>
    The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb).<br>
    Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. <br>
    Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.<br>
    These populations possibly are separate subspecies,<br>but this is disputed.
