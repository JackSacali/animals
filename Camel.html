<p> A camel (from: Latin: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Hebrew or Phoenician: גָמָל gāmāl.[7][8]) is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and,<br> as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. <br>There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%.<br> The wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.</p>
